# BionicTextConverter
## What?
Using python to create a programme that imports a file, converts it into bionic text (aka bolding the first half of the words) and outputs a file containing the bionic text.

## Why?
This project was inspired by a friend who recently got diagnosed with ADHD who has always struggled with absorbing the written word. We discovered that bionic text helps her read at twice the speed so I wanted to create a programme that would allow her to convert her documents into bionic text whenever she requires it.

## Current Progress
Currently the code can process basic word documents.

## Goals
I would like the code to develop as follows
* Add pictures from the input file into the output file (currently they are skipped)
* Develop the code to work on Google Docs
